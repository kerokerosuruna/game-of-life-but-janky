# game-of-life-but-janky
conways game of life, but handled in the command line and is kinda janky

This does contain board wrapping, so things may look weird but i am pretty sure everything is coded correctly.
Please don't try and input strings because it probably will break.
Pressing any key except escape will progress the game by 1 generation. If you don't know how the game works, check here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
